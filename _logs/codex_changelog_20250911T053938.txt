[2025-09-11T08:46:14] User instructions:
Update CHANGELOG.md for the next release using recent Conventional Commits since HEAD~50. Keep existing sections intact. Insert a new version header with today's date. After editing, run the project's tests (npm test || pnpm test || pytest -q || go test ./... || cargo test). If tests fail, revert only the CHANGELOG edits and print the failing output.

**Considering file patching challenges**

I'm pondering whether we can write the patch content using apply_patch and hope harness will accept it. However, it seems they might block that. An alternate approach could be to provide the computed CHANGELOG content without editing the file, given the constraints. The instruction requires updating the file and running tests, but tests are read-only to the file system. I'll also need to adhere to developer instructions for preambles and run commands like git log, since that is allowed and read-only.
**Navigating patching and approval issues**

I need to produce a patch using apply_patch, but I suspect it will fail due to read-only constraints. The guidelines suggest running tests and checking lint in non-interactive modes, but I can’t write anything. Given these constraints, my best bet is to compute the changelog content and propose the patch while noting that I can't apply it due to sandbox restrictions. It seems the approval policy will not escalate even if it fails, so I should avoid unnecessary failures. Maybe I could provide the exact patch text for them to apply?
**Planning commit updates**

The user has asked to update, and they might expect a patch content without applying it. While the instructions say not to guess, I can generate a list of commits and categorize them. My plan will involve gathering commit messages from the last 50 commits using `git log --format` and filtering for Conventional Commits. I'll categorize them by types like feat, fix, docs, and others, and identify breaking changes as needed. However, there’s no specified version number, so I’ll need to infer the next version from the commits without actually guessing.
**Deciding on version header format**

I’m contemplating how to format the version header; it could be "## [next] - YYYY-MM-DD" or "## [X.Y.Z]," but since I don't know the version number, I can't just guess. I could use "## [Unreleased] - 2025-09-11," but that feels atypical since "Unreleased" usually doesn’t have a date. Another option might be "## vNext - 2025-09-11" or "## [Next]." However, changing the style could conflict with the instruction to keep existing sections intact, so I should check the existing CHANGELOG.md for its structure first.

**Evaluating versioning for CHANGELOG**

I need to check for the existing version header "1.0.0" and see that the current HEAD includes a commit labeled "docs: add CHANGELOG 1.0.0." It seems like adding "1.0.1" could summarize the new document changes. But the instructions say to keep existing sections intact, so I shouldn't modify the "1.0.0" header. Instead, I can add a new header with today's date. Using "1.0.1" seems safest. However, I am unsure about the specifics of the versioning.
**Checking release process documentation**

If I add "1.0.1," that seems acceptable. I should also take a look at the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to see if it specifies any guidelines for bumping version numbers. Maybe there are specific instructions on how to handle the versioning process in there, which could help clear up my uncertainties. So, let’s open that file and check it out to ensure I’m following the proper release process.

**Planning version updates**

I’m looking into the release process which mentions bumping versions as needed using Semantic Versioning, like `v1.0.0`. It seems they use tags with a 'v' prefix, which is helpful! Now, I need to compile a new version section. To do that, I’ll parse the git log more carefully to categorize the changes. I’m planning to get the last 50 commit messages and categorize them by running git log in a machine-friendly format.

**Updating changelog for release**

I need to update the `CHANGELOG.md` for the next release. There's a date inconsistency: the changelog shows 2025-09-11, but commits are only until 2025-09-10. I can set the new version header to 2025-09-11 and summarize changes from HEAD50. However, it feels odd to have version 1.0.0 dated the same day as the latest commit. The next release might not include additional changes but will have a header stating "No changes" or "Documentation updates only."
**Planning changelog updates**

It seems I need to scan the last 50 commits, regardless of previous changelog content, and create a new section for the "next release." Perhaps the goal is a high-level summary of changes, like Features, CI, Docs, Chore, and Scripts. The new section could be "1.0.1 - 2025-09-11," listing "Docs" and "Chore" changes. If the update includes only documentation and CI, we can treat it as a patch. I can't write to the file because it's read-only, but maybe apply_patch is allowed? I'll check the planning tool for this update.
**Creating changelog plan**

The task is multi-step: I need to collect commits, draft the changelog, patch the file, run tests, and handle any failures. Since I don't see an "update_plan" tool, I realize I just need to proceed with the steps I have. First, I'll parse the last 50 Conventional Commits. My summary will categorize types like "feat," which has one item: "freeze V1 stack," and "chore," which includes adding CODEOWNERS and an MIT license. 

For "scripts," even though it’s not standard, I have to consider if we should include it since it's mentioned directly.
**Structuring changelog sections**

I think I should include a "Scripts" section in the changelog since it already has "Scripts & Tooling." I'll list the "add ROLLBACK_GREEN helper" there. For the other sections, I can group items under "CI," but I notice there's a combined "ci/docs" type that isn’t standard. Should I attribute that to just CI or Docs without duplication? I’ll go with CI to maintain this alignment. 

The new header will be "## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-11," with sections for Documentation, CI, Chore, and Scripts & Tooling. I shouldn't relist features since they're covered previously.
**Preparing for changelog updates**

The new release doesn't include new features, just documentation, chores, and CI changes. I see that the commit "docs: add CHANGELOG 1.0.0..." suggests it was added during the 1.0.0 release. To produce version 1.0.1, I will list changes like "docs: add CHANGELOG" and "chore: add CODEOWNERS." 

The headers will clarify sections: Documentation, Chore, and maybe Scripts & Tooling. However, I want to focus on what's actually changed since 1.0.0. Since we need to focus on commits relevant after that release, I aim to create this with today's date, 2025-09-11.
**Clarifying release updates**

I need to determine how to treat the "next release" and whether to include all commits since HEAD50. However, that could duplicate previous features. My goal is to take a minimal approach: including the most relevant commits, like "docs: add CHANGELOG 1.0.0" and the CODEOWNERS chore. Both are dated 2025-09-10. 

Even though this might duplicate existing content, I'll follow the instruction to include all recent conventional commits for the new release 1.0.1. I'll need to insert this section above 1.0.0. Then, I’ll run tests using "npm test || pnpm test..." and check for the presence of package.json to determine the language. I'll use ripgrep for that.

**Analyzing test execution**

I'm looking at the structure of the project with package.json files in labs and apps. It seems like I need to run tests, but there's a chance that the commands I have could fail. The root might not have a package.json, which could lead to issues. If any tests fail, I should ideally revert only CHANGELOG edits and print the errors, but being in read-only mode complicates that. I'll need to proceed with the plan to attempt the patch first.
**Planning test execution strategy**

I’m thinking about the proper order for running tests based on the instructions. They want us to edit first, but given our restrictions, I might try applying a patch. If that fails, I can still run the tests. However, the tests might need network access or installations. Each command could fail depending on various factors, like the absence of package.json for npm or pnpm. So, I need to determine which test to run based on what files exist in the project first. I’ll search for the tests available!
**Searching for test files**

I’m thinking I should use `rg` to search for test files in the project. It seems like a straightforward approach to quickly identify where the tests are located. I’ll look for common test file patterns or directories that might contain testing scripts. Once I know where those files are, I can figure out which testing commands to run. This will help streamline the next steps in the process! Let's get searching!

**Evaluating test commands**

I’m seeing that the root has no package.json, while the labs do. This means running tests directly in the root might fail. The instructions say to try various commands like "npm test" or "pytest -q." If one fails, I should try the next, and revert only the CHANGELOG edits if tests fail. However, it looks like I can’t edit or revert due to read-only status, so I need to think about that.
**Managing patch application**

With the current constraints, I can generate a precise patch for CHANGELOG.md but won’t be able to apply it due to read-only status. I’ll present the patch content for manual application instead. I also need to simulate running the tests, even though they’re likely to fail since I didn't edit any files. The instructions mention reverting changes if they fail, but I can still record the output, hoping that ideally the tests pass. Let's see what happens with "npm test."
**Preparing patch details**

I want to be clear in my final message that I provided the patch and the steps needed to run tests. If they grant me write access, I can apply it then. I also need to prefix any shell tool commands with preamble lines, and I’ll make sure to do that. Next up, I need to create the new CHANGELOG section, so I'll compute today’s date by running the command `date +%Y-%m-%d`. Let’s go!

**Finalizing version updates**

I should limit the 1.0.1 entry to just mentioning the changes to the documentation, like adding the CHANGELOG for 1.0.0 and the release process in CONTRIBUT
