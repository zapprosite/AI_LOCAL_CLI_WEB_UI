New Chat Prompt

This document captures the canonical prompt used by this repository for new chat and coding sessions. It serves as “project memory” to align tools and agents on goals, constraints, and tone.

Suggested sections:
- Goals and non-goals
- Operating constraints (privacy, networking, GPU availability)
- Style and response guidelines (concise, ops-first)
- Context pointers (services, ports, data paths)

Update this file when the stack’s behavior or expectations change. Keep it short and actionable.
